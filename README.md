## How it works in practice

All infrastructure configuration is based on Git, a deployment is triggered automatically when pushing code to Github. 
The Github status checks link to the CircleCI log output. 

Each branch is deployed to a dedicated environment based on its content. The URL of the 
environment can be found at the end of the CircleCI log output on a successful build.    


## FAQ

#### What does Silta mean?
It means "bridge" in Finnish.

#### Can I use Silta outside of Wunder?
Yes, our code is open. However, we haven't put special attention to this use case at this point.

#### Does Silta support multisite
This might be technically possible, but multisite setups provide little benefits in a container-based environment. 
Instead, it is recommended to trigger the deployment of multiple sites into dedicated environments from the same repository.
